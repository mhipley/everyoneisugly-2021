##### Description

Ekphrasis is a game about going to the museum to get away for a bit and to think about feelings you like to feel. It is a simple, short, narrative inspired by Rainer Maria Rilke's *"Archaic Torso of Apollo."*

The game is available to play for free [on itch.io](https://everyoneisugly.itch.io/ekphrasis).

##### Concept & History

Like the poem itself, the game is an ekphrasis: "a rhetorical device in which one medium of art tries to relate to another medium by defining and describing its essence and form, and in doing so, relate more directly to the audience, through its illuminative liveliness" ([source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekphrasis)).
