##### Description

*mood: quixotic* is a time-based digital work designed and coded for [Welcome to my Homepage](http://www.welcometomyhomepage.net/)’s digital residency program. Visitors to the site were allowed to peek into the world of Eddie, a teenage boy stalked via his Livejournal and hacked webcam by a female classmate. Throughout the month, objects moved and changed in the webcam view of the bedroom, and Eddie’s journal revealed increasingly creepy interactions with his secret admirer.

All textures and surfaces in the both the 3D world and the blog interface were hand-painted rather than digitally illustrated.

##### Concept & History

This subversion of the male gaze is intended to be both an unsettling reminder and nostalgic longing for an earlier time when the internet felt more innocent and bad behavior lacked a critical vocabulary.

##### Production Details

- web-based project made with Three.js
- hand-painted textures made for all 3D models
- exhibited in Welcome to my Homepage in April 2016
