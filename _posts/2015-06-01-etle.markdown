##### Description
The A.O. Movement Collective commissioned a narrative comic for the [ETLE Universe](http://www.theaomc.org/etle/) from me in 2013. The story appeared in ETLE ILLUS, published in 2015.

The story takes place within the timeline of the project's queer/feminist cyborg time travel epic, exploring a post-apocalyptic future where a violent gender revolution has ties to to our own past and present.


##### Concept & History
My contribution continues my own interest in subverting tropes of toxic masculinity with the female gaze and male characters in subservient emotional support roles. The story is essentially a romance, where two male characters find purpose and pleasure in serving a radical femme activist.


##### Production Details
- published in 2015 at the end of a 2-year immersive art cycle
- full-length comic book with hand-inked panels and digital color
