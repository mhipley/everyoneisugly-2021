##### Description

*ur cardboard pet* includes a series of VR projects and performances. it includes a web-based VR app, custom interactive hardware, and interactive activities designed for various exhibitions.

Your personal pet is a comfort object, offering unconditional nonsexual love and endless compliments. Later versions of the project include a personality test to assign your perfect boyfriend from an array of archetypes and an interactive headset that blushes, warms to your touch, and has a heartbeat that accelerates based on the intensity of your grip.

##### Concept & History

The project is a satire of feminization of user interfaces. As products of a heteronormative, male-dominated industry, devices are often personified as subservient females (Siri, Alexa, etc.) in no small part because this renders them non-threatening.

##### Production Details

- web app made with Three.js and Google VR SDK
- hand-painted illustrations of various “boyfriends”
- interactive hardware made with Arduino
- exhibited at Powrplnt, Haus der Elektronischen Künst, The Museum of Human Achievement, the NYC Internet Yami-ichi, and Carnegie Mellon University’s Art&&Code conference.
