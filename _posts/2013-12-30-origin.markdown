##### Description

*origin of love* is a series of 13 paintings that are a frame-by-frame recreation of a pornographic gif sourced from tumblr. It was first included in Tasty Zine's inaugural issue in 2013. Somewhat ironically, while the original paintings and the original gif are well-circulated on Tumblr to this day, a video of the paintings on display at Tasty's launch was removed for TOS violation.

##### Concept & History

The title of the series is a nod to Courbet's *"Origine du Monde."* The works were made with a distressed, layered technique to parallel the digital loss when a high resolution video is made into an animated gif. 

##### Production Details

- 13 paintings made with a technique of pigment layered sheets of vellum
- published in *Tasty Zine*'s inaugural issue in 2013

- a sequence of the paintings were also included in Outlet's _NSFW: Male Nudes by Female Painters_ exhibition in 2016.
