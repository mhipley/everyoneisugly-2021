                <p>
                    I am an artist and technologist with over a decade of experience in both commercial digital products and conceptual art. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am from Baltimore, Maryland but currently split time between Mexico City and New York City.

                    I like endurance sports and fashion but don't want to talk about either with anyone from the internet. You can learn more about me and my other interests on <a href="https://marthahipley.com/" target="_blank">my homepage</a>.

                <h2>artist statement</h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of artists say they can't imagine themselves doing anything but making art. I think this is kind of bullshit. I've had office jobs for most of my adult life and have spent the better part of a decade working in both large corporations and small startups in the technology sector.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am the person at the art party who has a lot of opinions about "apps" and actually understands how they work. I make work about my preoccupations with technology and the people who make it, about the extended adolescence of a life forever-online, about feeling stuck between a corporate world I loathe and an art world that I also don't really vibe with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like paintings and video games and want to make more of both.
                </p>
