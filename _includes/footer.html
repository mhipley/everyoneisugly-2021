                <p>
                    I am an artist and technologist with over a decade of experience in both commercial digital products and conceptual art. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am from Baltimore, Maryland but currently split time between Mexico City and New York City.

                    I like endurance sports and fashion but don't want to talk about either with anyone from the internet. You can learn more about me and my other interests on <a href="https://marthahipley.com/" target="_blank">my homepage</a>.

                <p>
                    I have a lot of loud and malleable opinions about technology, politics, and economics. I have mostly admiration for the arts (not including the art market or academia!) and don't really waste talking about art I don't enjoy. I tend to make art that is in homage to the creative works I love and a challenge to the things out in the real world I find frustrating. I'm particularly interested in exploring ideas about identity and sexuality in relationship to the rapidly moving target of digital life.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I like paintings and video games and want to make more of both.
